# Sudoku-Solver

This is simple sudoku game solver which takes input as 1D matrix of current board and predict output by solving it for different conditions which fits in.
It iterates over the empty cells filling the valid moves if no one fits then it will take one step back then continue the whole process till the sudoku solves.

###Improvements are most welcome :-)
